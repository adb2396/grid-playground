2. **Intermediate Developers**: Want to experiment with complex grid layouts
3. **Designers**: Need to understand grid capabilities for better design decisions
4. **Educators**: Teaching CSS Grid concepts to students

## ðŸ“‹ User Stories

### Core User Stories (MVP)

1. **As a user, I want to create a grid container**
   - So that I can start building a grid layout
   - Acceptance: Can create a div that acts as a grid container

2. **As a user, I want to add grid items to my container**
   - So that I can see how items are placed in the grid
   - Acceptance: Can add/remove child divs within the container

3. **As a user, I want to modify grid container properties**
   - So that I can understand how different properties affect the layout
   - Acceptance: Can change properties like:
     - display: grid
     - grid-template-columns
     - grid-template-rows
     - gap/grid-gap
     - justify-content
     - align-content
     - grid-auto-flow

4. **As a user, I want to see the grid lines and areas**
   - So that I can visualize the grid structure
   - Acceptance: Visual overlay showing grid lines, row/column numbers

5. **As a user, I want to modify individual grid item properties**
   - So that I can understand item placement
   - Acceptance: Can change properties like:
     - grid-column
     - grid-row
     - grid-area
     - justify-self
     - align-self

6. **As a user, I want to see live CSS code**
   - So that I can copy and use it in my projects
   - Acceptance: Real-time CSS code display that updates with changes

7. **As a user, I want to see the visual result immediately**
   - So that I can understand the impact of my changes
   - Acceptance: Live preview updates as properties change

### Enhanced User Stories (Phase 2)

8. **As a user, I want to save and share my grid layouts**
   - So that I can reference them later or share with others
   - Acceptance: Generate shareable links or export code

9. **As a user, I want to access pre-built templates**
   - So that I can learn from examples
   - Acceptance: Gallery of common grid patterns

10. **As a user, I want to see responsive behavior**
    - So that I can test grid layouts at different screen sizes
    - Acceptance: Viewport size controls and media query support
